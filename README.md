# Project 3 Comments from XJ

Dear BF528 TA(s),

Please find below instructions and details about the folder structure, contents, and usage for my ChIP-seq analysis project.

**Folder Structure & Content**
*module/*
This folder contains all my customized Nextflow process definitions. Each Nextflow module has been altered as needed for this project and saved here for reference or reuse.

*results/*

This is the output directory for the Nextflow pipeline. All outputs generated by the workflow (e.g., processed data files, QC metrics, intermediate results) are saved here automatically.

*data_analysis/*

Contains all the code used to analyze my ChIP-seq data. You can use these scripts to reproduce the results and figures shown in the report, including those from the original Figure 2F and Supplemental Figures S2A-C.

*reports/*

**All project reports are saved in this folder.**

1. Reports are available in both Microsoft Word format and Jupyter Notebook format.
For convenience and compatibility, a PDF version of the final report is also provided.
reports/ (continued)

2. All figures referenced in the report are saved in this folder for easy access.

*work/*

This temporary directory (usually created by Nextflow) has been removed to save disk space. Removing it does not affect reproducibility or access to final results and generated reports.

All files produced by the Nextflow pipeline are in the results/ directory.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know!

Best regards, 
Jessie
